# Traffic light simulation system

### Project Description

The aim of this project was to design and implement a simplified simulation of traffic lights using a master-slave architecture. The project aimed not only to reproduce the basic logic of traffic lights, but also to demonstrate how such systems can be implemented in real conditions using modern IT technologies and the principles applicable to industrial automation systems.

### Technological Context

In real industrial and infrastructure environments, such as smart cities or traffic management systems, solutions based on Operation Technology (OT) are widely used. One of the key components of such environments are SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems, which play the role of central supervision and control. SCADA systems communicate with distributed executive units, such as PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), which perform specific operations at the physical level, e.g. switching traffic lights on and off.

The master-slave architecture was chosen as a model reflecting this approach. In our case, the "master" is responsible for coordinating the entire system, while the "slave" responds to its commands and executes them in a manner consistent with the programmed logic.

### Implementation description

The created application is based on REST API technology, which ensures simple communication between components and easy scalability and integration with other systems. The application was divided into two independent microservices, each of which performs a specific function:

Master microservice - acts as a superior unit. It is responsible for managing the logic of the traffic light cycle (e.g. green → yellow → red), sending control commands to the slave unit, and time synchronization.

Slave microservice - receives commands from the master unit and executes them, emulating the physical operation of traffic lights. It can also send feedback on the status of task execution.

Communication between microservices takes place via HTTP requests in JSON format. This cooperation model reflects well the way in which modern distributed systems exchange data in real time.

### Frontend layer

For the purpose of better visualization of the system operation, a simple graphical interface (frontend) was also prepared, which presents the current status of traffic lights in real time. Data needed for visualization is retrieved from the slave microservice, which provides it in the form of a standardized API.

The frontend can operate both as a local web application and as a component integrated with a larger traffic management system. Thanks to this, it is possible to use this simulation as a prototype for more complex implementations.

##3 Summary

The project is an example of the use of modern programming solutions to represent the logic of classic automation systems. Thanks to the use of microservices, REST API and the master-slave approach, it was possible to create a flexible and readable architecture that can be easily developed and adapted to various scenarios. The project can be treated as an introduction to more advanced simulations of traffic control systems or as didactic material for learning the basics of OT and IoT systems in the context of software engineering.
